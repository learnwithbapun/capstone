Initial check in :

To push your local project to GitHub, you can follow these steps:  
Navigate to your project directory in your terminal.  
Initialize the local directory as a Git repository:

git init

1.Add all the files in your local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

git add .

2.Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:

git commit -m "First commit"

3.At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click the clipboard icon to copy the remote repository URL.  
In your terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed

git remote add origin <remote repository URL>

git remote add origin https://github.com/learnwithbapun/FirstSpringApp.git

if exist already -- git remote set-url origin https://github.com/learnwithbapun/FirstSpringApp.git


Replace <remote repository URL> with the URL you copied in the previous step.(First we need to create the repository in github)

<https://github.com/learnwithbapun/FirstSpringApp.git>

4.Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub:

git push -u origin master

Now, your local project has been pushed to your GitHub repository.
